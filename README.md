Shmupfest
=========

The Shmupfest is a game made by Pixelnest Studio for the [Stunfest 2014](http://stunfest.fr/), a french video game festival based in Rennes.

It's an infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up, created with Unity. Bullets patterns are designed and implemented with [BulletML for Unity](http://pixelnest.io/work/bulletml-for-unity).

All the sprites have been drawn by the [Ulule's backers](http://fr.ulule.com/stunfest-2014/), making the game truly unique and personalized for the festival.
